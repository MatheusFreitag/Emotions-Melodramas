[Verse 1]
Today is my birthday and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything

[Refrain]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Verse 2]
Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
I'm little but I'm coming for the title held by everyone who's up

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah
All work and no play, lemme count the bruises
All business all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play, lonely on that new shit, yeah
Yeah

[Bridge]
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?

[Refrain]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah
