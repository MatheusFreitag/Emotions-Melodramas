[Verse 1]
There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and a tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives
Unlimited spice would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

[Verse 2]
There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
It's tiger burn eyes in the dark-dark-dark-dark

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

[Outro]
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
