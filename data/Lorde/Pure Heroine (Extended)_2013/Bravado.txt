[Verse 1]
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up to be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing to assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that, when the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I learned not to want the quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go "oh"

[Beat Break]

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that, when the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I learned not to want the quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go "oh"
