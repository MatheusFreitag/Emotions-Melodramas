[Verse 1]
Six in the morning, can I hold you?
Are we done talking? Do we have to?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

[Post-Chorus]
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

[Verse 2]
Now I know what you want
But it's too late (Ayy, ayy, ah)
You're trying to bring me good love-loving
But it won't take (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
I've been thinking (I've been thinking)
We were over (We were over)
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking (I've been thinking), we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

[Post-Chorus]
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

[Chorus]
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

[Post-Chorus]
I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, ah)
I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I was thinking we were over (Ah)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, ayy, ayy, ah)
I was thinking we were over
