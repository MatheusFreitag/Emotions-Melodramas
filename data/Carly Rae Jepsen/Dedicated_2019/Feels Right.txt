[Verse 1: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right when it feels right

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Asa Taccone]
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I'd do, boy, anything to step with you

[Verse 2: Carly Rae Jepsen]
True fact
Baby, I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right (Maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Asa Taccone]
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
And I do, boy, anything to step with you

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right when it feels right
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life with no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Asa Taccone]
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I do, boy, anything to step with you
