[Verse 1]
Now you're in love, I can see you sold out
Where was I, pic-picture, cut my eyes out
"He’s so hypnotizing," said every girl you ever met
When I lose, when I lose, I hold out

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you’re living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Verse 2]
Turn me on, I'm jealous of that night watch
I'm the voyeur searching through my laptop
It's so truth defying, everything you ever said
Right or wrong, right or wrong, I won't stop

[Chorus]
You’re my baby
Come to bed, I’ll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she’s touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) I’ll be your girl
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Bridge]
Standing at your door, calling out your name
Find me in the dark, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest
Banging on your door, calling out your name
Find me in your heart, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Outro]
(Ah) All I mean is I'm going out of breath
(Ah) For the way that I feel when you hold me like that
(Ah) All I pray is I'm getting over it
(Ah) I'd trade places today if you'd love me like that
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
