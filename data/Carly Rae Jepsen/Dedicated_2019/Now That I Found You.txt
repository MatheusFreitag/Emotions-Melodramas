[Verse 1]
Waking up next to you every morning
How did we get this far? It came without a warning
And in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
You and me get too real but all I feel is alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a secret, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you

[Chorus]
Don't give it up, don't say it hurts
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Verse 2]
Give me the words I want, baby, just say it
You know me way too well to keep it complicated
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)
But I can't deny the moment when I taste it

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a secret, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you

[Chorus]
Don't give it up (Don't give it up)
Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all (I want it all)
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Bridge]
Thought it was impossible
It's just like a miracle
Say nothing's impossible now
Now that I found, now that I found you
Now that I found, now that I found you

[Chorus]
Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all (I want it all)
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you (Oh)
Now that I found you
Now that I found you (Oh)
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
