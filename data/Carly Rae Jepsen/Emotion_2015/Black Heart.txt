[Verse 1]
I don't care 'bout your good intentions
I care more 'bout your bad dreams
I wanna love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the blossom tree
(Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?)
You're my miracle, oh-oh-oh
Under the blossom tree
(Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?)
'Cause you're my miracle, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting

[Verse 2]
You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You're a cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the blossom tree
(Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?)
You're my miracle, oh-oh-oh
Under the blossom tree
(Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?)
You're my miracle

[Chorus]
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting

[Outro]
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)
