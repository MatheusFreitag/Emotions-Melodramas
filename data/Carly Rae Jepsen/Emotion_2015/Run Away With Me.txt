[Verse 1]
You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you

[Verse 2]
This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Verse 3]
Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep
We never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Bridge]
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold, ooh
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold

[Chorus]
My baby, take me to the feeling (take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away)
Run away with me (with me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Outro]
Run away with me, run away with me
Run away with me, run away with me
