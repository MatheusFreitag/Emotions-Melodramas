[Verse 1]
Worlds fly by
Drove by your place, and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
I can't lie
I like the feeling how you make me shy
I'll share my secrets, and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two

[Chorus]
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

[Verse 2]
Eyes so bright
You've got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn, but still I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
But when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat break in two
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Fall into me and then

[Chorus]
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

[Bridge]
Gimmie love (ooh)
It's the way we are together (ooh)
Wanna feel like this forever, forever (ooh)
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever say forever

[Chorus]
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
