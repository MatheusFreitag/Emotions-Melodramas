[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
It's your fault
Baby boy, cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light
With your eyes onto me in the darkness

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Baby, I...
I'm not going anywhere without you
Walk me home
Cause I like every single thing about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?
