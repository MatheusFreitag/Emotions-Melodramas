[Verse 1]
What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
You come to me in dreams at night
(You come to me in dreams at night)
I wake up and I see the light

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone?
When I needed someone
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, I thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
My feet up to my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone?
When I needed someone
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey

[Interlude]
You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night

[Bridge]
I don't want to work it out
I'm not going to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No, I'm not going to, still...

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone when I needed someone?
When I needed, hey
When I needed, hey
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey
Hey, when I needed you...
