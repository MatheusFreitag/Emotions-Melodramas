[Verse 1]
I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to LA
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But money makes your whole world spin
'Til everything is dizzy, and
And, suddenly...

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night he and I
Filling up each other's pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game
Cause suddenly...

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Bridge]
Buzzfeed buzzards, and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?
Buzzfeed buzzards, and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, then will you let me go?

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Chorus + (Bridge)]
Take me into your arms again
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, will you let me go?)
Take me into your arms again
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
